# CollabApp

CollabApp is a platform designed to facilitate collaboration on various projects. Users can create, join, and contribute to different projects. A key feature of CollabApp is the ability to generate highlights for each project, providing a quick overview to help users decide whether they want to join. Additionally, joining a project requires a password, ensuring that only authorized users can contribute.

## Features

- **Project Collaboration**: Users can create and join projects, making it easy to collaborate with others.
- **Project Highlights**: Each project can generate a summary to provide an overview, helping users quickly understand the project before joining.
- **Secure Access**: Projects are password-protected, ensuring that only authorized users can join and contribute.
